# Hearts-Cardgame

I worked in a two-person team on this project, where our responsibilities included writing converters,
integrating game logic and flow, and implementing both a local and network mode for up to 4 players. 
Additionally, we developed a custom AI client and fully integrated it into the game, 
ensuring it functions seamlessly alongside the human players.
